# Campaign Sets

Campaign sets are the core of Dotoro's campaign generation system. They combine data sources, templates, and rules to generate hundreds or thousands of campaigns automatically.

## What is a Campaign Set?

A campaign set is a configuration that defines:

- **Data Source** - Where campaign data comes from
- **Template** - How campaigns are structured
- **Rules** - Conditional logic for generation
- **Platform** - Target advertising platform
- **Sync Settings** - How changes are pushed

## Campaign Hierarchy

Dotoro generates a three-level hierarchy matching platform structures:

```
Campaign Set
└── Campaigns (1 per data row or grouping)
    └── Ad Groups (based on template structure)
        └── Ads (individual ad creatives)
```

### Example: E-commerce Product Campaigns

```
Campaign Set: "Spring Sale Products"
├── Campaign: "Shoes - Running"
│   ├── Ad Group: "Men's Running Shoes"
│   │   ├── Ad: "Nike Air Max - $89"
│   │   └── Ad: "Adidas Ultraboost - $120"
│   └── Ad Group: "Women's Running Shoes"
│       └── Ad: "Brooks Ghost - $130"
└── Campaign: "Shoes - Casual"
    └── Ad Group: "Lifestyle Sneakers"
        └── Ad: "Converse All-Star - $60"
```

## Creating a Campaign Set

### Step 1: Basic Configuration

1. Navigate to **Campaign Sets** > **New Campaign Set**
2. Enter a descriptive name
3. Select target advertising platform
4. Choose the advertising account to sync to

### Step 2: Connect Data Source

1. Select an existing data source or create new
2. Preview available columns
3. Verify row count and data quality

### Step 3: Configure Templates

Define how data maps to campaign structure:

**Campaign Level:**
```
Name: &#36;{brand} - &#36;{category} - &#36;{region}
Budget: &#36;{daily_budget}
Status: enabled
```

**Ad Group Level:**
```
Name: &#36;{product_type}
Default Bid: &#36;{cpc_bid}
```

**Ad Level:**
```
Headline: &#36;{product_name} | Now &#36;{price}
Description: &#36;{description}
URL: &#36;{product_url}
```

### Step 4: Apply Rules

Add rules to filter data or modify campaigns:

- Include only in-stock products
- Set budgets based on margin
- Apply promotional messaging

### Step 5: Preview and Generate

1. Click **Preview** to see generated campaigns
2. Review campaign count and structure
3. Check for validation warnings
4. Click **Generate** to create campaigns

## Sync Status

Campaign sets track synchronization state:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Not yet synced to platform |
| `syncing` | Sync in progress |
| `synced` | All campaigns up to date |
| `partial` | Some campaigns failed to sync |
| `error` | Sync failed completely |

### Sync Operations

**Initial Sync:**
- Creates all campaigns on the platform
- Uploads creative assets
- Applies targeting settings

**Update Sync:**
- Detects changes in data source
- Updates modified campaigns
- Adds new campaigns for new rows
- Optionally pauses campaigns for deleted rows

**Manual Sync:**
```
Campaign Set > Actions > Sync Now
```

## Managing Campaign Sets

### Bulk Operations

Perform actions on multiple campaign sets:

- **Sync All** - Update all campaign sets
- **Pause All** - Pause syncing
- **Archive** - Move to archive

### Campaign Set Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sync** | Push changes to platform |
| **Preview** | View generated campaigns |
| **Edit** | Modify configuration |
| **Duplicate** | Create a copy |
| **Archive** | Stop syncing and archive |
| **Delete** | Remove permanently |

### Monitoring

The campaign set dashboard shows:

- Total campaigns generated
- Sync status and last sync time
- Campaign performance metrics
- Error counts and warnings

## Advanced Configuration

### Grouping Strategies

Control how data rows become campaigns:

**One Campaign Per Row:**
```yaml
grouping: none
# Each data row = 1 campaign
```

**Group by Column:**
```yaml
grouping: column
column: category
# All rows with same category = 1 campaign
```

**Custom Grouping:**
```yaml
grouping: expression
expression: "&#36;{region}-&#36;{category}"
# Custom grouping logic
```

### Naming Patterns

Use variables in campaign names:

```
Pattern: "[&#36;{region}] &#36;{category} - &#36;{brand}"
Result: "[US-West] Electronics - Samsung"
```

**Reserved variables:**
- `&#36;{_row_number}` - Data row index
- `&#36;{_timestamp}` - Generation timestamp
- `&#36;{_campaign_set}` - Parent campaign set name

### Budget Allocation

**Fixed Budget:**
```yaml
budget_type: fixed
budget: 100
# Each campaign gets $100/day
```

**Proportional Budget:**
```yaml
budget_type: proportional
total_budget: 5000
weight_column: revenue
# Budget allocated by revenue share
```

**Dynamic Budget (via Rules):**
```yaml
rules:
  - condition: margin > 50
    action: budget = budget * 1.5
```

### Scheduling

Control when campaigns are active:

```yaml
schedule:
  start_date: "2025-01-01"
  end_date: "2025-01-31"
  time_zone: "America/New_York"
  day_parting:
    - days: [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday]
      hours: [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**"Missing required field":**
- A required column is empty in your data
- Solution: Add fallback values or filter empty rows

**"Character limit exceeded":**
- Ad text exceeds platform limits
- Solution: Shorten templates or truncate variables

**"Invalid targeting":**
- Targeting configuration is invalid
- Solution: Verify geo-codes, interests, etc.

**"Budget below minimum":**
- Platform requires higher minimum budget
- Solution: Increase budget or combine campaigns

### Error Recovery

When syncs fail:

1. Review error details in campaign set
2. Fix data source or template issues
3. Click **Retry Failed** to re-sync only failed items
4. Monitor sync status

### Rollback

Revert to previous state if needed:

1. View sync history
2. Select previous sync point
3. Click **Restore** to revert changes
4. Re-sync to apply restored configuration

## Performance Optimization

### Large Campaign Sets

For campaign sets with 1000+ campaigns:

1. **Use filters** - Reduce rows with filter rules
2. **Batch syncing** - Enable incremental sync
3. **Limit preview** - Preview sample only
4. **Monitor quotas** - Stay within platform API limits

### Sync Efficiency

Optimize sync performance:

- **Delta sync** - Only sync changed campaigns
- **Parallel processing** - Sync multiple campaigns simultaneously
- **Asset caching** - Reuse uploaded images/videos

## Best Practices

### Organization

1. **Name clearly** - Include purpose, platform, date
2. **Document configuration** - Add notes explaining choices
3. **Version templates** - Track template changes
4. **Archive old sets** - Keep workspace clean

### Quality

1. **Preview before sync** - Always review generated campaigns
2. **Start small** - Test with subset of data first
3. **Monitor after sync** - Check platform for issues
4. **Review performance** - Adjust based on results

### Maintenance

1. **Schedule syncs** - Automate regular updates
2. **Set alerts** - Get notified of sync failures
3. **Review regularly** - Update rules as business changes
4. **Clean up** - Remove unused campaign sets
