# Data Sources

Data sources are the foundation of Dotoro's campaign generation system. They provide the dynamic content that powers your advertising campaigns across platforms.

## What is a Data Source?

A data source is a connection to structured data that Dotoro uses to generate campaigns. Each row in your data source can become a campaign, ad group, or ad with unique content based on your configuration.

## Supported Data Source Types

### Google Sheets

Connect directly to Google Sheets for real-time data synchronization.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic updates when spreadsheet changes
- Collaborative editing with your team
- No file uploads required

**Setup:**
1. Click **New Data Source** > **Google Sheets**
2. Authorize Dotoro to access your Google account
3. Select the spreadsheet and worksheet
4. Map columns to campaign variables

### CSV Upload

Upload static data files for one-time or periodic campaign generation.

**Supported formats:**
- CSV (comma-separated values)
- UTF-8 encoding recommended for special characters

**Upload process:**
1. Click **New Data Source** > **CSV Upload**
2. Drag and drop or browse for your file
3. Preview detected columns
4. Confirm column mapping

### REST API

Connect to external APIs for real-time data from e-commerce platforms, CRMs, or custom systems.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "type": "api",
  "endpoint": "https://api.yourstore.com/products",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer \${API_KEY}"
  },
  "refreshInterval": 3600
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic refresh at configurable intervals
- Header authentication support
- JSON response parsing

## Column Mapping

Column mapping defines how your data source fields become campaign variables.

### Variable Syntax

Use the `\${variable_name}` syntax in templates to reference data source columns:

| Data Source Column | Variable | Example Value |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| `product_name` | `\${product_name}` | "Premium Widget" |
| `price` | `\${price}` | "29.99" |
| `category` | `\${category}` | "Electronics" |

### Required Columns

Some columns are required depending on your campaign type:

- **Headline/Title** - Primary ad text (max 30-90 characters depending on platform)
- **Description** - Supporting ad text
- **Final URL** - Landing page destination

### Optional Enrichment

Enhance your data with computed fields:

- **Transforms** - Aggregate or modify data before use
- **Rules** - Apply conditional logic to filter rows

## Sync and Refresh

### Manual Sync

Trigger an immediate sync from the data source detail page:

1. Open your data source
2. Click **Sync Now**
3. Review sync status and any errors

### Scheduled Refresh

For Google Sheets and API sources, configure automatic refresh:

- **Hourly** - Best for frequently changing data
- **Daily** - Suitable for stable product catalogs
- **Weekly** - For rarely changing content

### Sync Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `synced` | Data is current |
| `syncing` | Sync in progress |
| `error` | Sync failed - check error details |
| `stale` | Data older than refresh interval |

## Best Practices

### Data Quality

1. **Clean headers** - Use clear, lowercase column names without spaces
2. **Consistent formatting** - Maintain uniform date, currency, and text formats
3. **No empty rows** - Remove blank rows to avoid empty campaigns
4. **Unique identifiers** - Include a unique ID column for tracking

### Performance

1. **Limit row count** - Large data sources (10,000+ rows) may slow sync times
2. **Filter at source** - Pre-filter data before connecting to Dotoro
3. **Use transforms** - Aggregate data to reduce campaign volume

### Security

1. **Protect API keys** - Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
2. **Limit permissions** - Grant only read access to data sources
3. **Review access** - Audit team member permissions regularly

## Troubleshooting

### "Column not found" Error

Your template references a column that doesn't exist in the data source.

**Solution:** Verify column names match exactly (case-sensitive).

### "Sync failed" Error

The data source couldn't be accessed.

**Solutions:**
- For Google Sheets: Re-authorize if access expired
- For API: Verify endpoint URL and credentials
- For CSV: Re-upload the file

### "Invalid data format" Error

A column contains data in an unexpected format.

**Solution:** Check for mixed data types in numeric columns.
