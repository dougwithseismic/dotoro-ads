# Connecting Reddit Ads to Dotoro

This guide walks you through connecting your Reddit Ads account to Dotoro for campaign management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A Dotoro account with appropriate permissions

## Step 1: Prepare Your Reddit Ads Account

2. Click **Sign Up** or **Get Started**
3. Complete the account setup wizard
4. Verify your email address

### Add a Funding Instrument

Dotoro requires a valid funding instrument to sync campaigns:

1. In Reddit Ads, go to **Billing**
2. Click **Add payment method**
3. Enter your payment details
4. Set a billing threshold if desired

### Note Your Account ID

You'll need this during connection:

2. Your account ID looks like: `t2_xxxxxx`

## Step 2: Initiate Connection in Dotoro

### Navigate to Accounts

### Start Reddit Connection

1. Click **Connect Account**
2. Select **Reddit Ads** from the platform list
3. Review the permissions Dotoro will request

## Step 3: Authorize Access

### Reddit OAuth Flow

2. Review the requested permissions:
   - **Read account info** - View your ad accounts
   - **Manage ads** - Create and edit campaigns
   - **View reports** - Pull performance data
3. Click **Allow** to authorize Dotoro

### Handle Authorization Issues

**"Access denied" error:**

- Start the connection process again

## Step 4: Select Ad Accounts

### Choose Accounts to Manage

After authorization:

2. Select the accounts you want to manage
3. Click **Connect Selected Accounts**

### Account Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Personal** | Individual advertiser account |
| **Business** | Company/organization account |
| **Agency** | Multi-client management account |

### Multiple Accounts

You can connect multiple Reddit ad accounts:

- Each account appears separately in Dotoro
- Campaigns are organized by account
- Billing remains per-account in Reddit

## Step 5: Verify Connection

### Check Connection Status

### Verify Permissions

Dotoro will show if any permissions are missing:

- ✅ **Full access** - All features available
- ⚠️ **Limited access** - Some features restricted
- ❌ **No access** - Re-authorization required

## Managing Connected Accounts

### View Account Details

In **Settings > Accounts**:

- View connected account name and ID
- See last sync time
- Check connection health

### Refresh Authorization

Reddit tokens expire periodically. To refresh:

1. Click the account menu (⋮)
2. Select **Refresh Authorization**
3. Re-authorize if prompted

### Disconnect Account

To remove a Reddit connection:

1. Click the account menu (⋮)
2. Select **Disconnect**
3. Confirm disconnection

**Note:** Disconnecting removes Dotoro's access but does not affect live campaigns in Reddit.

## Account Permissions

### Required Permissions

Dotoro requests these Reddit permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `ads.read` | View campaigns and performance |
| `ads.write` | Create and edit campaigns |
| `account.read` | View account details |
| `reports.read` | Pull performance reports |

### Granting Additional Permissions

If new Dotoro features require more permissions:

| **Viewer** | View only |

### Adding Team Members

## Security Considerations

### Token Security

- Dotoro encrypts all OAuth tokens

To revoke Dotoro's access from Reddit:

1. Go to your [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)

**Warning:** This immediately breaks the connection and stops all syncing.

### Audit Access
