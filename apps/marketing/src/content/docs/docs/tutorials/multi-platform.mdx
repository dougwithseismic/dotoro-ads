- Analyze cross-platform performance

## The Multi-Platform Advantage

### Why Advertise Across Platforms?

| Platform | Strengths | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Reddit** | Community engagement, niche targeting | Brand awareness, tech products |
| **Google** | Intent-based, high volume | Direct response, search queries |
| **Meta** | Visual, detailed targeting | Lifestyle, e-commerce |

### Dotoro's Approach

Single data source → Multiple platform-specific campaign sets → Coordinated results

## Step 1: Design Your Data Structure

### Core Product Data

Create a unified data source with platform-agnostic fields:

```csv
product_id,name,description,price,image_url,url,category,target_audience
SKU-001,Premium Headphones,Crystal clear audio,79.99,/img/headphones.jpg,/products/headphones,Electronics,audiophiles
SKU-002,Running Shoes,Lightweight performance,129.99,/img/shoes.jpg,/products/shoes,Sports,runners
```

### Platform-Specific Fields

Add columns for platform variations:

```csv
# Reddit-specific
reddit_subreddits,reddit_headline
"r/headphones,r/audiophile","🎧 The headphones r/audiophile is raving about"

# Google-specific
google_keywords,google_headline_1,google_headline_2
"wireless headphones,bluetooth earbuds","Premium Wireless Headphones","Free Shipping Today"

# Meta-specific
meta_interests,meta_primary_text
"electronics,gadgets","Looking for amazing sound quality? 🎵"
```

### Full Multi-Platform Structure

| Column | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `product_id` | Unique identifier | All |
| `name` | Product name | All |
| `price` | Display price | All |
| `image_url` | Product image | All |
| `url` | Landing page | All |
| `description` | Base description | Fallback |
| `reddit_headline` | Reddit ad copy | Reddit |
| `reddit_subreddits` | Target communities | Reddit |
| `google_headlines` | RSA headlines | Google |
| `google_keywords` | Target keywords | Google |
| `meta_primary_text` | Facebook copy | Meta |
| `meta_interests` | Interest targeting | Meta |

## Step 2: Create Platform-Specific Templates

### Reddit Template

```yaml
name: Reddit - Product Ads
platform: reddit

campaign:
  name: "[Reddit] \${category} Products"
  objective: conversions
  budget: \${reddit_budget}

ad_group:
  name: "\${name}"
  targeting:
    communities: \${reddit_subreddits}
  bid:
    strategy: cpc
    amount: 0.75

ad:
  headline: "\${reddit_headline|\${name} - Now $\${price}}"
  body: |
    \${description}

    Check it out: \${url}
  image: \${image_url}
```

**Reddit-specific considerations:**
- Conversational tone
- Community-aware targeting
- Longer body text allowed

### Google Template

```yaml
name: Google - Search Ads
platform: google

campaign:
  name: "[Google] \${category}"
  objective: conversions
  budget: \${google_budget}

ad_group:
  name: "\${name}"
  keywords: \${google_keywords}
  match_type: phrase

ad:
  headlines:
    - "\${google_headline_1|\${name}}"
    - "\${google_headline_2|$\${price}}"
    - "Shop \${category} Today"
  descriptions:
    - "\${description}"
    - "Free shipping on orders $50+"
  final_url: \${url}?utm_source=google
```

**Google-specific considerations:**
- Multiple headline variations
- Character limits (30 chars headlines)
- Keyword relevance

### Meta Template

```yaml
name: Meta - Image Ads
platform: meta

campaign:
  name: "[Meta] \${category}"
  objective: conversions
  budget: \${meta_budget}

ad_set:
  name: "\${name}"
  targeting:
    interests: \${meta_interests}
    age_range: [25, 55]
    placements: [facebook_feed, instagram_feed]

ad:
  primary_text: "\${meta_primary_text|\${description}}"
  headline: "\${name}"
  description: "Starting at $\${price}"
  link: \${url}?utm_source=meta
  image: \${image_url}
  cta: "Shop Now"
```

**Meta-specific considerations:**
- Visual-first format
- Detailed audience targeting
- Emoji-friendly copy

## Step 3: Coordinate Budgets

### Budget Allocation Strategy

Allocate your total budget across platforms:

**Option 1: Fixed Split**
```csv
product_id,total_budget,reddit_budget,google_budget,meta_budget
SKU-001,100,20,50,30
SKU-002,150,30,75,45
```

**Option 2: Calculated Split**
Add a transform to calculate platform budgets:

```yaml
transform:
  name: Budget Calculator
  compute:
    reddit_budget: total_budget * 0.20
    google_budget: total_budget * 0.50
    meta_budget: total_budget * 0.30
```

**Option 3: Performance-Based**
Use rules to adjust based on historical performance:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Boost performing platforms
    condition: google_roas > 3
    action: google_budget = google_budget * 1.2
```

### Budget Caps

Set platform-level budget limits in each campaign set:

| Platform | Daily Cap | Monthly Cap |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Reddit | $500 | $10,000 |
| Google | $1,000 | $20,000 |
| Meta | $750 | $15,000 |

## Step 4: Create Campaign Sets

### Create Reddit Campaign Set

1. **Campaign Sets > New Campaign Set**
2. Name: `Multi-Platform - Reddit`
3. Platform: Reddit Ads
4. Data Source: Your unified data source
5. Template: Reddit - Product Ads
6. Add rules for Reddit-specific filtering

### Create Google Campaign Set

1. **Campaign Sets > New Campaign Set**
2. Name: `Multi-Platform - Google`
3. Platform: Google Ads
4. Data Source: Same unified data source
5. Template: Google - Search Ads
6. Add rules for Google-specific filtering

### Create Meta Campaign Set

1. **Campaign Sets > New Campaign Set**
2. Name: `Multi-Platform - Meta`
3. Platform: Meta Ads
4. Data Source: Same unified data source
5. Template: Meta - Image Ads
6. Add rules for Meta-specific filtering

### Platform-Specific Rules

Apply different rules per platform:

**Reddit: Community-friendly products**
```yaml
filter: reddit_subreddits is not empty
```

**Google: Products with search demand**
```yaml
filter: google_keywords is not empty
```

**Meta: Visual products with lifestyle appeal**
```yaml
filter: meta_interests is not empty AND image_quality = "high"
```

## Step 5: Manage Cross-Platform Sync

### Sync Strategy

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Simultaneous** | All platforms sync together | Coordinated launches |
| **Staggered** | Platforms sync at different times | Reduce API load |
| **Independent** | Each platform has own schedule | Platform-specific needs |

### Recommended Schedule

```yaml
# Reddit: Morning sync (US East)
reddit_sync:
  time: "08:00"
  timezone: "America/New_York"

# Google: Afternoon sync
google_sync:
  time: "14:00"
  timezone: "America/New_York"

# Meta: Evening sync
meta_sync:
  time: "20:00"
  timezone: "America/New_York"
```

### Cross-Platform Coordination

Create a master campaign set group:

1. Go to **Campaign Sets**
2. Create a folder: `Multi-Platform - Q1 2025`
3. Move all related campaign sets into folder
4. Use folder actions for bulk operations

## Step 6: Analyze Cross-Platform Performance

### Unified Reporting

Dotoro aggregates performance across platforms:

| Metric | Reddit | Google | Meta | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Spend | $2,500 | $5,000 | $3,750 | $11,250 |
| Clicks | 8,500 | 12,000 | 15,000 | 35,500 |
| Conversions | 85 | 180 | 150 | 415 |
| CPA | $29.41 | $27.78 | $25.00 | $27.11 |
| ROAS | 2.8x | 3.2x | 3.5x | 3.2x |

### Performance Comparison

Compare the same products across platforms:

```sql
-- Example analysis query
SELECT
  product_id,
  platform,
  SUM(spend) as spend,
  SUM(conversions) as conversions,
  SUM(revenue) / SUM(spend) as roas
FROM campaign_performance
GROUP BY product_id, platform
ORDER BY roas DESC
```

### Cross-Platform Insights

Identify platform strengths by category:

| Category | Best Platform | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Electronics | Reddit | Tech-savvy community engagement |
| Fashion | Meta | Visual discovery, lifestyle targeting |
| Services | Google | Intent-based search queries |

## Optimization Strategies

### Platform Rebalancing

Shift budget to top performers:

```yaml
rule: Weekly Platform Rebalancing
trigger: weekly
action:
  - Calculate ROAS per platform
  - Increase budget 10% for top performer
  - Decrease budget 10% for lowest performer
  - Maintain minimum $500/platform
```

### Message Testing

Test different messaging per platform:

| Version | Reddit | Google | Meta |
|---------|--------|--------|------|
| A | Community tone | Feature-focused | Lifestyle |
| B | Technical specs | Benefit-focused | Social proof |
| C | Reddit memes | Problem-solution | User testimonials |

### Audience Expansion

Use insights to expand targeting:

1. Identify top-performing audiences per platform
2. Create lookalike audiences (Meta)
3. Expand keyword lists (Google)
4. Target related subreddits (Reddit)

## Troubleshooting

### "Platform sync out of date"

1. Check individual platform connection status
2. Verify API credentials haven't expired
3. Review platform-specific error logs

### "Budget overspend"

1. Verify platform-level caps are set
2. Check for overlapping audience (cross-platform attribution)
3. Adjust frequency caps

### "Inconsistent performance data"

1. Confirm attribution windows match across platforms
2. Account for platform reporting delays
3. Use Dotoro's unified reporting for consistency

## Best Practices

### Creative Consistency

1. **Unified brand voice** - Adapt tone, maintain identity
2. **Consistent visuals** - Same product images, platform-optimized sizes
3. **Aligned messaging** - Core value prop across platforms

### Operational Efficiency

1. **Single source of truth** - One data source, multiple outputs
2. **Template inheritance** - Base template with platform overrides
3. **Centralized rules** - Global rules applied across platforms

### Performance Focus

1. **Platform-appropriate KPIs** - Different goals per platform
2. **Cross-platform attribution** - Understand the full journey
3. **Incremental testing** - Test one variable at a time
