# Building a Product Feed Campaign

This tutorial walks you through creating advertising campaigns that automatically generate from your e-commerce product catalog. By the end, you'll have a scalable system that creates unique ads for each product.

## What You'll Build

A complete product advertising system that:

- Connects to your product data (Google Sheets or CSV)
- Generates individual campaigns for each product category
- Creates ads with dynamic product information
- Syncs automatically when products change

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] A Dotoro account
- [ ] A connected advertising account (Reddit, Google, or Meta)
- [ ] Your product data in a spreadsheet or CSV

## Step 1: Prepare Your Product Data

### Data Structure

Organize your product data with these columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `product_id` | Unique identifier | `SKU-12345` |
| `product_name` | Product title | `Premium Wireless Headphones` |
| `category` | Product category | `Electronics` |
| `price` | Sale price | `79.99` |
| `description` | Short description | `Crystal clear audio...` |
| `image_url` | Product image URL | `https://...` |
| `url` | Product page URL | `https://shop.com/...` |
| `inventory` | Stock quantity | `150` |

### Sample Data

Here's example data to use:

```csv

## Troubleshooting

### "Product image not displaying"

- Verify image URL is publicly accessible
- Check image meets platform requirements (size, format)
- Test image URL in an incognito browser window

### "Character limit exceeded"

- Shorten product descriptions
- Use truncation in template: `\${description:0:100}...`
- Create platform-specific templates

### "Sync failing for some products"

- Check individual product data quality
- Review validation warnings in preview
- Look for special characters in text fields
